# Local-File-Inclusion-Payloads
Local File inclusion (LFI), or simply File Inclusion, refers to an inclusion attack through which an attacker can trick the web application into including files on the web server by exploiting a functionality that dynamically includes local files or scripts. The consequences of a successful LFI attack include Directory Traversal and Information Disclosure as well as Remote Code Execution.
